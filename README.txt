  STOCK PRICE PREDICTION SYSTEM
  AIT102 — Python and TensorFlow Programming
  Group Final Project
========================================================

DESCRIPTION
-----------
This application uses a deep learning LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)
neural network, built with TensorFlow/Keras, to predict future stock
closing prices. Historical price data is fetched live from Yahoo Finance.

The program accepts a stock ticker symbol and a forecast horizon from
the user, trains an LSTM model on 2 years of data, evaluates it on a
held-out test set, and outputs both numerical forecasts and saved charts.

The program offers two interfaces:
  1. Desktop App  — Tkinter GUI window
  2. Web App      — Flask browser interface with news feed

========================================================
HOW TO GET STARTED
========================================================

STEP 1 — Download the code
---------------------------
Open your browser and go to:
   https://github.com/jolinzz123/stock_prediction

Click the green "Code" button → Click "Download ZIP"
Extract the ZIP file to your Desktop or any folder you can find.

STEP 2 - Install required libraries
-------------------------------------
In the VSCode terminal, run:
   pip install -r requirements.txt

STEP 3 — Run the program
-------------------------
In the terminal, run:
   python main.py

Then choose:
   1 — Desktop App  (a window will pop up)
   2 — Web App      (open http://127.0.0.1:5000 in your browser)

  FOR TEAMMATES — HOW TO PUSH YOUR CHANGES TO GITHUB
========================================================
After editing your file, follow these steps to upload to GitHub.

Step 1 — Make sure you are in the project folder in VSCode terminal
   The terminal should show: ...stock_prediction>
   If not, run:  cd path\to\stock_prediction

Step 2 — Check which files you changed:
   git status

Step 3 — Stage your changes:
   git add .

Step 4 — Commit with a message describing what you did:
   git commit -m "Your message here"

   Examples:
   git commit -m "Fix data preprocessing in data_fetcher.py"
   git commit -m "Add dropout layer to model.py"
   git commit -m "Update forecast table in index.html"

Step 5 — Pull latest changes from GitHub first (IMPORTANT):
   git pull origin main

   If you see conflicts, contact the group leader.

Step 6 — Push your changes:
   git push origin main

Step 7 — Go to https://github.com/jolinzz123/stock_prediction
   Refresh the page to confirm your files are uploaded.

⚠  Always run git pull before git push to avoid conflicts.
⚠  Only edit your own assigned file — do not touch others' files.
⚠  git push will ask for your GitHub username + Personal Access Token
   (NOT your GitHub password — generate a token at:
   GitHub → Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens)

REQUIREMENTS
------------
- Python >= 3.9
- Internet connection (required to fetch stock data from Yahoo Finance)
- Minimum ~500MB disk space (for TensorFlow and model files)
- Webcam / GPU not required; CPU training is fully supported


SAMPLE TICKERS TO TRY
----------------------
  AAPL    Apple Inc.
  TSLA    Tesla Inc.
  GOOG    Alphabet (Google)
  MSFT    Microsoft Corporation
  AMZN    Amazon.com
  NVDA    NVIDIA Corporation
  META    Meta Platforms
  BABA    Alibaba Group


OUTPUT FILES
------------
After each prediction run, the following files are saved in assets/:

  <TICKER>_prediction.png  — Full chart: training history, test predictions,
                              and future forecast overlay
  <TICKER>_forecast.png    — Zoomed chart: last 90 days + future forecast
  <TICKER>_loss.png        — Model training/validation loss curve


DISCLAIMER
----------
This application is built for educational purposes as part of an
academic coursework project. All predictions are outputs of a machine
learning model and do NOT constitute financial advice. Do not make
real investment decisions based on this tool.


KNOWN LIMITATIONS
-----------------
- Prediction accuracy degrades beyond ~10 days (compounding error in
  recursive forecasting is expected behaviour for LSTM models).
- Stocks with less than 100 days of trading history are not supported.
- Model training takes 1–3 minutes on CPU depending on hardware.
- Weekend and public holiday dates are automatically skipped in forecasts
  (business-day calendar is used).
